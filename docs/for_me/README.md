# Docs for me 📚

This folder contains per-handler documentation extracted from `src/handlers/file_handler.rs` with detailed, line-by-line explanations.

Files:

- `list_files.md` — walkthrough and explanation for `list_files` handler
- `upload_file.md` — walkthrough and explanation for `upload_file` handler

---

💡 Tip: If you want me to expand these with examples (cURL, HTML form), tests, or to link them into the main `README.md`, tell me where you'd like them added.
